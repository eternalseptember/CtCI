Answers to hints:


Hint #213:
Are "friendships" mutual? Yes
Do status messages exist? Yes
Do you support group chat? Yes

Only one of the users need to be friends with someone in order to invite them
to a group chat.


Hint #271:
How will you know if a user signs offline?

Theoretically, bcause I won't be implementing the client/server connectivity
aspects here, since I feel like those go beyond the scope of
"object-oriented design"...

The chat does not require both parties to be online at the same time.
If a message is sent when a user is offline, they'll receive the messages the
next time they sign on.

But the client-side could update the server periodically to show that the users
are still signed on, when they're signing off, or when they put themselves in
"hidden" status.


Main difference between simple chat and group chat:
In the simple Chat objects, the user participation list will not be updated,
but the chat history will always be maintained by the server.

Group chat's participation list will be dynamically updated based on users
entering and leaving.
When the last member leaves the group chat, the server is updated to close the
chat.


There are two ways to invite people to group chat:
1.) Form a group chat outside any chat window.

2.) Inviting people inside a group chat window.
Any current participant can invite a contact to the group chat.

Previously, tried to allow chat participants to invite anyone to an existing
chat, but if the chat was a simple two-party chat, trying to figure out the new
chat_id for the group chat became too complicated, especially if multiple
people are inviting people to the group chat.


There are horizontal lines in chat_server.py and users.py.
The sections are:
- object information
- users
- contacts
- basic chats and messaging
- group chats
