Answers to hints:


Hint #213:
Are "friendships" mutual? Yes
Do status messages exist? Yes
Do you support group chat? Yes

Only one of the users need to be friends with someone in order to invite them
to a group chat.


Hint #271:
How will you know if a user signs offline?
The chat does not require both parties to be online at the same time.
If a message is sent when a user is offline, they'll receive the messages the
next time they sign on.

But the client-side could update the server periodically to show that the users
are still signed on, when they're signing off, or when they put themselves in
"hidden" status.
