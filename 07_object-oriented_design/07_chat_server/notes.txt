Answers to hints:


Hint #213:
Are "friendships" mutual? Yes
Do status messages exist? Yes
Do you support group chat? Yes

Only one of the users need to be friends with someone in order to invite them
to a group chat.


Hint #271:
How will you know if a user signs offline?
The chat does not require both parties to be online at the same time.
If a message is sent when a user is offline, they'll receive the messages the
next time they sign on.

But the client-side could update the server periodically to show that the users
are still signed on, when they're signing off, or when they put themselves in
"hidden" status.


Main difference between simple chat and group chat:
More info about the simple chat will be maintained by the server.
In the chat objects, the user participation list will not be updated.

Group chat's participation list will be dynamically updated based on users
entering and leaving.
When the last member leaves the group chat, the server is updated to close the
chat.
