"""
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value
(which might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the
number of paths that sum to a given value. The path does not need to
start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downards (traveling
only from parent nodes to child nodes).
